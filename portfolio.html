                <p>From the high-speed world of Formula 1 aerodynamics to building technology for social impact, my journey has been guided by a singular question: <em>How can we build systems that serve humanity responsibly?</em></p>
                <p>My work sits at the intersection of <strong>systems thinking, responsible AI, and technology for social impact</strong>—taking complex technical challenges from theory to real-world deployment while maintaining a steadfast focus on ethics and human-centered design.</p>
