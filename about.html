                <p>
                    And before all of that? I was an aerodynamicist and data
                    scientist for Formula One racing teams—Renault F1 and Toyota
                    F1. I optimized vehicle performance, worked trackside during
                    races, and helped capture a World Championship. It was an
                    incredible way to start a career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a third culture kid who spent formative years across
                    multiple continents, I developed an early capacity for
                    navigating different cultural contexts and perspectives.
                    This background shaped my approach to technology
                    deployment—building systems requires understanding not just
                    the technical architecture, but the human and cultural
                    systems they'll operate within. Whether it's deploying
                    environmental sensors in the Bay Area, building data
                    platforms in Ethiopia, or implementing AI systems
                    responsibly, I've learned that effective technology work
                    demands both technical rigor and cultural fluency. The
                    ability to bridge different worldviews isn't just personal
                    history; it's become fundamental to how I approach complex,
                    cross-functional challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I studied Aerospace Engineering at
                    <a

                        >Virginia Tech</a
                    >
                    and earned my Master's in Aerodynamics & Computation from
                    the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk"

                        >University of Southampton</a
                    >. I'm also a certified FAA Remote Pilot and a PADI
                    Divemaster.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm drawn to hard problems at the intersection of technology
                    and real-world impact—whether that's autonomous systems,
                    privacy-preserving AI, humanitarian data analytics, or
                    climate solutions. I believe in building systems that work,
                    deploying them thoughtfully, and iterating based on what
                    actually happens in the field. Field deployments have taught
                    me that sometimes slow is fast, that engaging local experts
                    is essential, and that staying flexible while maintaining
                    technical rigor produces the best outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work, I'm an avid drone pilot, scuba diver, and
                    traveler. I'm fascinated by the fundamentals of system
                    design and the challenge of making complex technology
                    actually useful.
